<p>
  This page lists all publications, lectures, and other occurrences of my work
  in the media. This list only aims to include all scientific works, not
  necessarily blog posts, journalistic or opinion pieces.

<p>
  This list is automatically retrieved from my Zotero library and is hence
  always updated. As a goodie, you are able to select the CSL style to output
  the list in.
